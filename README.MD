# Khinsider-Ripper

This branch is Xcode 9 and 10 compatible, but doesn't have dark mode support. It has not been updated since 5th of June 2020, so its highly encouraged to move to master for forks/projects based on this.

A simple Khinsider ripper made with SwiftSoup and Swift. Needs at least Xcode 10.3 to open.

## Currently available platforms for GUI Mode:

- macOS 10.12 and up
- iOS 9.3 and up

#### Note on iOS 10 and below:

iOS has only introduced the Files App in iOS 11. If you run the App on iOS 10 and below you need a jailbroken phone with a files app or iTunes. Some of the Apps features may not work properly. The app is considered in Legacy-Mode for iOS 9 to support people who are stuck with old devices.

## Working on CLI Mode for the following platforms:

- macOS
- Linux
- Android (use a terminal emulator or adb shell!)

## Soon to come:

- A Kotlin port for Android and Windows
- Improved Downloading (make it faster)
- Full changelogs in this readme ;_;

## Compilation:

To compile this project you need an Xcode Version supporting Swift 5 (Xcode 10.3 and up). Open up the workspace file, add your apple developer account for signing and have fun building!

Instructions for CLI and Kotlin version coming soon.
